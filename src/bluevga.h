   BlueVGA library - VGA Driver Library for STM32F103

   - This library is intended to work in Arduino IDE using Bluepill STM32F103C8 or STM32F103CB boards
   - It works on both STM32 Core and Roger's core for STM32F103C board.
   - It was tested and runs using the following Arduino Settings for the board:
       Generic STM32F103C series
       Optimize Os (Smallest)
       Variant STM32F103C8 or STM32F103CB
       CPU Speed(MHz) 72MHz (Normal)

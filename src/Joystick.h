/*
   BlueVGA library - VGA Driver Library for STM32F103

   - This library is intended to work in Arduino IDE using Bluepill STM32F103C8 or STM32F103CB boards
   - It works on both STM32 Core and Roger's core for STM32F103C board.
   - It was tested and runs using the following Arduino Settings for the board:
       Generic STM32F103C series
       Optimize Os (Smallest)
       Variant STM32F103C8 or STM32F103CB
       CPU Speed(MHz) 72MHz (Normal)

/*
 * 
 * This Class can be used with an Arduino Analog Joystick like the one viewed in this video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8iaW5YcsNE 
 * or it can also handle Push Buttons for each direction and another for "fire".
 * When creating the instance of this class, if pin used for left and right are the same, it assumes it is been used an analog joytick for left/right
 * The same for up and down.
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * Joystick joystick(PA3, PA3, PA4, PA4, PB5);  // assumes an analog joystick using PA3 for right/left, PA4 for up/down and PB5 for "fire"
 * Joystick joystick(PA1, PA2, PA3, PA4, PB5);  // assumes ues of push buttons which are in PULL_UP state, thus by driving each pin to Ground will activate it
 * Joystick joystick(PA3, PA3, PA4, PA5, PB5);  // assumes a mixing of analog joystick with push butom, by using PA3 for right/left (analog), and digital signals in PA4 up, PA5 down and PB5 "fire"
